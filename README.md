# Travel-Responsive-Website
Travel website using html , css , javascript and sql as database . 
I have developed a fully responsive travel website using a combination of HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript, designed to provide an engaging and seamless user experience. 
The website is equipped with a backend SQL database that securely stores user-submitted booking information, including names and other relevant details, ensuring efficient data management. 
The site features several essential sections, including a dynamic Home Page that introduces visitors to the platform's offerings, an About Us Page that details the mission and vision of the service, and a comprehensive Terms and Conditions Page to provide transparency and build trust with users.
Additionally, the Explore Page invites users to discover a wide array of destinations, while the Packages Page offers a curated selection of travel plans tailored to various preferences and budgets.
The responsive design ensures the website adapts smoothly to various devices and screen sizes, offering users a consistent experience whether they access it from a desktop, tablet, or smartphone. The integration of backend functionality with PHP allows for real-time data handling and enhances the interactivity of features like bookings.
This project reflects a perfect blend of modern web technologies and user-centric design principles, delivering a robust platform that meets the diverse needs of travelers.
